Everything is possible, such as assigning it customized images, classing it in the category of your choice,&nbsp;<strong>optimizing your SEO<\/strong>, writing a customized description, attributing it an EAN code or a specific reference, configuring its volume to calculate delivery costs, etc...<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>For those that are pressed for time, and in order to facilitate their marketing,&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Pack<\/strong>&nbsp;will automatically display all the photos of the products that make it up, as well as their descriptions, in the form of tabs.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Your customers will be correctly informed, without leaving the page of your pack, and&nbsp;<strong>able to finalise their purchase in one click<\/strong>.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>And that&#39;s not all... For more visibility, your packs will automatically be&nbsp;<strong>highlighted on their data sheets<\/strong>&nbsp;for those being sold in lots<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>This way, you will encourage your customers to order the pack, rather than the product they were initially interested in. Essentially, this is&nbsp;<strong>cross-selling<\/strong>: an accessible method of&nbsp;<strong>increasing your average shopping cart<\/strong>&nbsp;!<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>We don&#39;t forget designers<\/strong><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>From the beginning, we have integrated the fact that this module should be easily adapted by your web agency or designer\/integrator.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>The module adapts itself perfectly to the default PrestaShop 1.6 and 1.7 themes, whilst allowing the most advanced graphic personalization.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>A set of JavaScript templates and CSS style sheets are delivered as models with the module,&nbsp;<strong>to facilitate the integration process<\/strong>.

The \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module is actually the perfect solution for offering your respected customers free shipping through objective rules. It is the promise of <strong>a rise in the amount of orders<\/strong> with total <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong>.<br \/><br \/>The module allows you to calculate in advance, with the help of precise rules, the necessary conditions for unlocking free delivery. The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.<br \/><br \/>The \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module offers <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong> by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier<br \/>In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to <strong>order more<\/strong>.<br \/><br \/>Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really <strong>control the impact<\/strong> of delivery costs.<br \/>The second report displays the detail of costs caused by free postage and the orders where the rules for free shipping are applied. Thus, the \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module increases the value of transactions as well as the number of orders!<br \/><br \/>This module has been constantly evolving, many thanks to user feedback.

Not only to solve the task of putting the right product in front of the right customer, but also to improve the store navigation for customers browsing things they are, or could be, interested in. Recommendations help you drive revenue through cross-selling and up-selling, but it also drives revenue by increasing the customer experience on your site. Our recommendations drive an increase in revenue that is often noticeable within a few weeks, along with increase in engagement and time spent on store.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Why using a recommendation engine?<\/strong><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">The most essential task of a recommender system is to serve up relevant content to the user at the right time. A product recommendation engine provide relevant products to store visitors to increase the likelihood of turning the visitor into a customer. Much like Netflix&#39;s recommender system aims to increase time spent at Netflix by serving up movies and series that the user is likely to want to watch.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">It is hard to serve the right product to the right visitor, at the right time. Doing this through featured products or featured categories is often as close to getting it &quot;right&quot; a store owner can get without spending a lot of time on maintaining the &quot;you may also like&quot; section for every product in store. This is impractical and the recommendation engine simply offers a better way of doing it. The algorithm analyses data on customers purchasing patterns and order history to derive the products a visitor is most likely to buy and putting them right in front of them, in real-time. Across all products in the assortment, served every hour, every day.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>An Engage account is required and additional fees may apply.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Monthly plans start at $7 \/mo and include 7 days free trial (no credit card required).<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Get more information about our pricing here: engage.zubi.ai<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n","tab":"merchandizing","version":"1.0.2","compatibility":{"from":"1.6.1.0","to":"1.7.7.5"},"nbRates":"4","product_type":"module","avgRate":"4.5","price":{"EUR":0,"USD":0,"GBP":0},"badges":[{"label":"Official Partner","img":"https:\/\/medias2.prestastore.com\/themes\/prestastore\/img\/front\/sprites\/badges\/ps-official-partner.png"}],"cover":{"small":"https:\/\/medias2.prestastore.com\/1422277-pprod\/product-recommendations-by-engage.jpg","big":"https:\/\/medias2.prestastore.com\/1422277-pbig\/product-recommendations-by-engage.jpg"},"changeLog":{"1.0.0":["Initial version"],"1.0.1":["Bug Fix: Fixes an issue in where images did not display correctly in v1.6.1.24"],"1.0.2":["Bug Fix: Fixes an issue in where orders are sometimes tracked incorrectly."]}},{"id":"49266","name":"bdroppy","displayName":"BDroppy- The best brands for your dropshipping business","categoryName":"Marketplace & Affiliation Platforms","categoryId":"74","categoryParentName":"PrestaShop Modules","categoryParentEnglishName":"PrestaShop Modules","categoryParentId":"2","description":"Import thousands of top branded products into your store in just a few clicks and manage your entire business in dropshipping with a single dashboard","author":"PrestaShop Partners","url":"https:\/\/addons.prestashop.com\/en\/marketplace-prestashop-modules\/49266-bdroppy-the-best-brands-for-your-dropshipping-business.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download","img":"https:\/\/medias1.prestastore.com\/img\/pico\/49266.jpg","fullDescription":"<div>Import thousands of top branded products into your store in just a few clicks and manage your entire business in dropshipping with a single dashboard.
